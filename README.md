# VHDL-Projects 

This repositorie contains my projects that I personally think are super cool 
My journey with Verilog and SystemVerilog (or with programming in general) is Self-learned. 

My focus here is primarily on V/SV desgin and verification of common beginner IPs.

you shall find all the projects in their specific folders within this order

----> Diagrams 
----> RTL Design
----> Testbench 
----> Simulation Results 

thank you :)
